        A Small Idea with a Big Impact

      EcoHaven was born out of a simple belief: everyday products should not harm the planet. Our founder, Emma Carter, started this journey in 2020 after seeing the growing impact of plastic waste on the environment. What began as a passion project turned into a missionâ€”to create beautifully handcrafted, eco-friendly alternatives for daily living.

      Today, EcoHaven partners with small artisans to bring you sustainable, high-quality products that are kind to the earth and elevate your lifestyle.
