## 🌿 Overview

EcoHaven is a modern e-commerce platform focused on sustainable and eco-friendly products. The application is built using Next.js and features a responsive design with TailwindCSS for styling.

- Verify that responsive design adapts correctly to different screen sizes

## 👑 Admin Access

**Note:** While admin components exist in `app/components/admin/` (such as AdminHeader.tsx), there is currently no dedicated admin route implemented in the `app/` directory. The following instructions are for future implementation:

To access the admin dashboard and test administrative functions:

1. Navigate to the login page
2. Enter the following credentials:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin`
3. After successful login, you will be redirected to the admin dashboard

### Admin Dashboard Testing
- Verify product management (add, edit, delete products)
- Test order management (view, update status, cancel orders)
- Verify user management if available
- Test inventory management functionality
- Verify that admin-only actions are properly secured

**Development Note:** When implementing the admin route, create it under `app/admin/` and utilize the existing admin components.

## 📦 Dependencies

The EcoHaven project relies on the following key dependencies:

- **Next.js 15.2.1**: React framework for production
- **React 19.0.0**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **shadcn/ui**: Reusable UI components built with Radix UI and Tailwind
- **@radix-ui**: Unstyled, accessible UI component primitives
- **@mui/material**: Material UI component library
- **next/font**: For optimized font loading (Geist)
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
- **Lucide React**: Icon library

For a complete list of dependencies, refer to the `package.json` file.

## 🎨 Styling

EcoHaven uses a combination of:

### TailwindCSS
- Utility-first approach for rapid UI development
- Responsive design utilities
- Custom theme configuration in `tailwind.config.js`

### Custom CSS
- Additional custom styles in `app/components/landing/homes.css`
- Component-specific styling
- Custom animations and transitions

To modify the styling:
1. For TailwindCSS customizations, edit the `tailwind.config.js` file
2. For custom styles, modify the `app/components/landing/homes.css` file
3. Use Tailwind's `@apply` directive to create reusable custom classes

## 💻 Development Guidelines

### Code Structure
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow the file naming conventions established in the project

### Development Environment
- The project uses Next.js development server with the `--turbopack` flag for faster builds
- Run the development server using the scripts defined in `package.json`

### State Management
- Use React hooks for local state management
- For more complex state, use context providers located in `app/contexts`
- The project includes a CartContext (in `app/contexts/CardContext.tsx`) for managing shopping cart state

### Adding New Features
1. Create new components in the appropriate directory under `app/components`
2. Update the relevant parent components to include your new feature
3. Add any necessary styles using TailwindCSS or custom CSS
4. Test thoroughly across different screen sizes

## 🌐 Deployment

### Deployment Options

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

For alternative deployment options, check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying).
